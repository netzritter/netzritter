🐈  𝐂𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐚𝐭. 👀 

🌱 I have a long history in building ecosystems in the Tech Sector.

🔭 My life motto is tied to technology, following the principle of “𝙞𝙛 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙢𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙚𝙨𝙩 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣 𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙧𝙤𝙤𝙢, 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙬𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙜 𝙧𝙤𝙤𝙢”. 

⚓ I was lucky enough to meet and work with the brightest people on this planet, although I started in a very bureaucratic system before shaping the future.

🚁 In 1992 I started my professional career as a helicopter pilot and digital transformation officer in the German Armed Forces. During these inspiring times, I led a mission in Afghanistan as a NATO chief negotiator and organized the first free parliamentarian elections. 

🚀 In 2007 I was able to help a start-up to raise $50 M out of $200 M to send the first private constellation of remote sensing satellites into space. 

🍺 Subsequently, I held various leadership positions at several high-tech companies, including Google, Thales, and Software AG. With a background in electrical engineering, I was significantly involved in the foundation of the Cyber Command within the German DoD.
 
💊 In my latest ventures I founded the digital lab of BIOTRONIK - a family-owned global market leader in the cardiology sector. My team worked on life saving solutions which empowered me to do deeper research on rising technologies like AI and Blockchain, but not forgetting aspects of Cyber Threads and Security. 

🆘 Not sure where and when my next chapter will start, but if it’s not technology enabled, I might have missed the right exit 😊

🏁 My future roles are non-hierarchical driven, meaning that working as an individual contributor or team captain or Managing Director is not as important as 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿.
